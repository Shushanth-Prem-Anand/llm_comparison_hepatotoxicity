Reactive metabolite formation via dual pathways: Isoniazid undergoes N-acetylation by NAT2 to acetylisoniazid, then hydrolysis to acetylhydrazine; alternatively, direct hydrolysis generates hydrazine—both metabolites are hepatotoxic and undergo further oxidation by CYP2E1 to reactive intermediates
NAT2 polymorphism creates complex risk pattern: Slow acetylators (homozygous NAT2 variants) accumulate parent isoniazid favoring hydrazine formation; rapid acetylators generate more acetylhydrazine—both pathways produce toxicity, creating a "U-shaped" or bimodal risk curve though epidemiologic data show variable patterns
Mitochondrial dysfunction drives hepatocyte injury: Reactive metabolites (particularly acetylhydrazine derivatives) impair mitochondrial respiration, deplete mitochondrial DNA, trigger oxidative phosphorylation uncoupling, and induce mitochondrial permeability transition leading to ATP depletion and necrosis
Oxidative stress via multiple mechanisms: CYP2E1-mediated metabolism generates ROS; mitochondrial dysfunction amplifies oxidative damage; reactive metabolites deplete glutathione and form protein adducts—creating a pro-oxidant cellular environment
Immune-mediated component in subset of cases: Some patients exhibit fever, rash, eosinophilia suggesting hypersensitivity; protein adducts may act as neoantigens triggering adaptive immune responses; however, most hepatotoxicity appears metabolically driven rather than primarily immunologic
Subacute onset (4 weeks to 6 months): Hepatotoxicity typically manifests after 1-6 months of therapy (peak 2-3 months), reflecting cumulative metabolite exposure and progressive mitochondrial damage; asymptomatic transaminase elevations occur in 10-20% of patients, with clinical hepatitis in 0.1-1%
Age and alcohol as cofactors: Risk increases significantly after age 35 (mechanisms unclear but may involve reduced mitochondrial reserve); chronic alcohol consumption induces CYP2E1 enhancing reactive metabolite formation and depletes hepatic glutathione
Generally reversible with early discontinuation: Most cases resolve upon isoniazid withdrawal if detected early; however, delayed recognition can lead to acute liver failure (1-10% of symptomatic cases), particularly in older patients or those with advanced fibrosis
