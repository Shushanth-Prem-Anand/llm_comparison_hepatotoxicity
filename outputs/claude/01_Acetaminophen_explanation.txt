Reactive metabolite (NAPQI) formation dominates: At therapeutic doses, acetaminophen is safely conjugated via sulfation/glucuronidation; toxic doses saturate these pathways, shunting metabolism through CYP2E1/CYP3A4 to generate N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI)
Glutathione depletion triggers cascading injury: NAPQI normally detoxified by hepatic glutathione; when glutathione depleted (>70%), free NAPQI covalently binds to cellular proteins, initiating mitochondrial damage and triggering the mitochondrial permeability transition
Mitochondrial dysfunction amplifies oxidative stress: NAPQI adducts disrupt respiratory chain complexes, causing ATP depletion, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and mitochondrial DNA fragmentation—creating a feed-forward oxidative injury cycle
Dose-dependence reflects metabolic capacity: Hepatotoxicity threshold typically >150 mg/kg (or 7.5-10 g in adults) corresponds to saturation of safe conjugation pathways; individuals with depleted glutathione (malnutrition, chronic alcohol) show lower thresholds
Acute time course (hours to 3 days): Peak toxicity manifests 24-72 hours post-ingestion as necrosis progresses through centrilobular (zone 3) hepatocytes where CYP2E1 expression is highest
Reversibility window exists: N-acetylcysteine (glutathione precursor) administered within 8-10 hours effectively replenishes detoxification capacity; delayed treatment faces established necrosis with limited reversibility
Immune mechanisms are secondary: Unlike idiosyncratic hepatotoxins, acetaminophen toxicity is intrinsic and dose-related; sterile inflammation occurs after necrosis but is not the primary driver
Cholestasis is minimal: Acetaminophen primarily causes hepatocellular necrosis rather than bile duct injury; minor BSEP inhibition reported but clinically insignificant compared to metabolite-driven hepatocyte death
