Structure identified as meperidine (pethidine): The SMILES represents ethyl 4-phenylpiperidine-1-carboxylate, a synthetic opioid analgesic with decades of clinical use; hepatotoxicity is uncommon and NOT a characteristic adverse effect of this medication
Very low documented hepatotoxicity: Unlike acetaminophen or NSAIDs, meperidine is not recognized as a hepatotoxic opioid; extensive clinical experience shows rare isolated case reports of transaminase elevations, typically in context of overdose, chronic abuse, or confounding factors (viral hepatitis, alcohol, polysubstance use)
Metabolic pathways generate stable products: Meperidine undergoes N-demethylation (CYP3A4, CYP2B6) to normeperidine (active metabolite) and hydrolysis of the ester to meperidinic acid; these metabolic pathways do not typically generate highly reactive electrophiles or deplete glutathione at therapeutic doses
Minimal reactive metabolite formation: The phenylpiperidine structure and ethyl carbamate moiety lack toxicophores associated with bioactivation to reactive intermediates; aromatic hydroxylation may occur but generates detoxifiable phenolic metabolites rather than quinones or other reactive species
No significant mitochondrial toxicity: Meperidine does not inhibit mitochondrial respiration, does not cause microvesicular steatosis, and lacks structural features (lipophilic cations, long-chain fatty acids) associated with mitochondrial dysfunction; opioids as a class generally spare mitochondrial function
Neurotoxicity, not hepatotoxicity, is primary concern: Normeperidine accumulation (particularly in renal impairment or with repeated dosing) causes tremors, myoclonus, and seizures; this neurotoxic liability has reduced meperidine's clinical use, but hepatotoxicity is not a limiting factor
Minimal cholestatic or immune-mediated mechanisms: No established pattern of cholestatic injury, BSEP inhibition unlikely given structural features, and immune-mediated hypersensitivity reactions to meperidine are exceptionally rare; the piperidine scaffold is generally well-tolerated immunologically
Clinical context: Meperidine is avoided in modern pain management due to neurotoxic metabolite and abuse potential rather than hepatotoxicity concerns; it remains safe from a hepatic standpoint at therapeutic doses; any suspected hepatotoxicity should prompt evaluation for alternative causes (viral hepatitis, ischemia, concomitant hepatotoxic drugs) as meperidine-induced liver injury would be extremely unusual
