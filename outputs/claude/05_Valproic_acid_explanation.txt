Profound mitochondrial dysfunction dominates: Valproic acid and its metabolite 4-en-valproic acid directly inhibit mitochondrial β-oxidation of fatty acids by depleting free coenzyme A and carnitine, impairing multiple steps in the β-oxidation cycle, causing microvesicular steatosis and hepatocyte energy failure
Inhibition of respiratory chain complexes: Valproate metabolites interfere with mitochondrial electron transport chain (particularly Complex I and IV), impair ATP synthesis, trigger mitochondrial permeability transition, and deplete mitochondrial DNA—creating severe bioenergetic crisis in hepatocytes
Reactive metabolite formation via CYP-mediated pathways: Omega and omega-1 oxidation by CYP2C9, CYP2A6, and CYP2C19 generates hepatotoxic metabolites including 4-en-VPA (potent mitochondrial toxin) and 2,4-diene-VPA; these unsaturated metabolites undergo further bioactivation to reactive species
Carnitine depletion exacerbates toxicity: Valproate conjugates with carnitine forming valproylcarnitine (excreted in urine), depleting free carnitine pools needed for mitochondrial fatty acid transport; this compounds β-oxidation inhibition and worsens microvesicular steatosis
Oxidative stress secondary to mitochondrial failure: Impaired electron transport generates ROS, fatty acid accumulation promotes lipid peroxidation, and ATP depletion compromises antioxidant defenses—creating progressive oxidative damage particularly in metabolically active periportal hepatocytes
High-risk populations reflect mitochondrial vulnerability: Children <2 years (immature mitochondrial systems), patients with underlying mitochondrial disorders (POLG mutations, Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome), polytherapy with enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants (increase toxic metabolite formation) show 10-50× higher risk
Dose-dependent with threshold effects: Risk increases with doses >50 mg/kg/day; hepatotoxicity incidence ~1 in 500 in high-risk groups versus 1 in 40,000 in adults on monotherapy; microvesicular steatosis seen at therapeutic doses, but severe/fatal hepatotoxicity typically involves higher exposure or genetic susceptibility
Variable reversibility depends on timing: Early asymptomatic transaminase elevations often resolve with dose reduction; however, once microvesicular steatosis progresses to hepatic encephalopathy and hyperammonemia (Reye-like syndrome), mortality reaches 40-80% despite drug discontinuation and supportive care including L-carnitine supplementation
