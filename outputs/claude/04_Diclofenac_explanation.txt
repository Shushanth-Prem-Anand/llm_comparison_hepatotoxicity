Reactive acyl glucuronide as key toxicant: Diclofenac undergoes UGT2B7-mediated glucuronidation to form an unstable acyl glucuronide that undergoes intramolecular rearrangement and transacylation reactions, covalently binding to hepatic proteins (particularly mitochondrial proteins) and triggering downstream toxicity
Mitochondrial dysfunction is central mechanism: Diclofenac and its metabolites directly impair mitochondrial function by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation, opening the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, depleting ATP, and causing mitochondrial swelling—particularly affecting hepatocytes with high metabolic demand
Oxidative stress amplifies injury: Mitochondrial dysfunction generates ROS; diclofenac metabolism by CYP2C9/CYP3A4 produces quinone-imine reactive intermediates; acyl glucuronide reactivity depletes cellular antioxidants—creating synergistic oxidative damage in susceptible individuals
Immune-mediated component in subset: Evidence includes rechallenge positivity, hypersensitivity features (fever, rash, eosinophilia) in ~20% of cases, anti-CYP2C9 autoantibodies in some patients, and protein adducts serving as neoantigens; HLA-DRB11501 and HLA-A3301 associations reported but not consistently validated
Mixed cholestatic-hepatocellular pattern: While predominantly hepatocellular injury (80%), ~20% show mixed or cholestatic features; diclofenac acyl glucuronide inhibits BSEP and MRP2 transporters (though less potently than troglitazone), contributing to bile acid accumulation in some cases
Subacute onset (1-6 months typical): Most cases present after 1-3 months of therapy (median 6-12 weeks), though acute presentations (<1 week) and late-onset cases (>12 months) reported; incidence ~1-5 per 100,000 users, higher than most other NSAIDs
Dose-related and idiosyncratic features coexist: Higher doses (150 mg/day) and sustained-release formulations show increased risk, suggesting dose-dependent component; however, unpredictable individual susceptibility indicates idiosyncratic overlay involving genetic and environmental factors
Generally reversible with discontinuation: Most cases resolve within weeks to months after stopping diclofenac if caught early; however, ~10% progress to severe/fulminant hepatic failure with mortality ~5-10%, particularly with delayed recognition or continued exposure despite symptoms
