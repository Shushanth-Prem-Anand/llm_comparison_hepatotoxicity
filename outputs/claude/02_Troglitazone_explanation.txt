Multi-mechanistic idiosyncratic hepatotoxin: Troglitazone withdrawn in 2000 after causing severe hepatotoxicity (including acute liver failure) in ~1.9% of patients; toxicity involves convergence of mitochondrial injury, reactive metabolites, and cholestatic mechanisms
Mitochondrial toxicity is central: Troglitazone and its sulfate metabolite directly inhibit mitochondrial respiratory chain (Complex I), uncouple oxidative phosphorylation, depolarize mitochondrial membrane potential, and trigger the mitochondrial permeability transition—leading to ATP depletion and hepatocyte death
Reactive quinone metabolite formation: CYP3A4-mediated oxidation generates reactive quinone species from the chromane ring; these electrophiles form protein adducts, deplete glutathione, and may trigger immune responses through haptenization of cellular proteins
BSEP inhibition causes cholestatic component: Troglitazone potently inhibits bile salt export pump (BSEP/ABCB11) with IC50 ~0.4-1 μM, causing intracellular bile acid accumulation; cholestatic features observed in ~50% of hepatotoxicity cases with elevated alkaline phosphatase
Oxidative stress amplifies injury: Mitochondrial dysfunction generates ROS, quinone metabolites undergo redox cycling, and bile acid accumulation triggers oxidative signaling—creating synergistic oxidative damage particularly in susceptible individuals
Subacute onset (1-6 months): Most cases presented after 2-6 months of therapy, suggesting cumulative mechanisms (mitochondrial adaptation failure, progressive bile acid accumulation) rather than immediate intrinsic toxicity; rare acute presentations also occurred
Immune-mediated component suspected: Recurrent hepatotoxicity upon rechallenge, peripheral eosinophilia in some cases, and formation of protein adducts suggest adaptive immune involvement, though HLA associations not established as with other immune-mediated hepatotoxins
Variable reversibility: While many cases resolved upon discontinuation, ~10% progressed to acute liver failure requiring transplantation; irreversibility linked to extent of mitochondrial damage and cholestatic injury before drug withdrawal
