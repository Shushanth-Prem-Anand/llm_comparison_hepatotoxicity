Low hepatotoxicity for amoxicillin alone: Amoxicillin monotherapy rarely causes clinically significant hepatotoxicity (incidence <1 per 100,000); most reported hepatotoxicity involves amoxicillin-clavulanate combination (Augmentin), where clavulanate appears to be the primary driver with incidence ~1-17 per 100,000 users
Immune-mediated mechanism predominates: Classic features of hypersensitivity including rash, fever, eosinophilia in 30-50% of cases; delayed onset (1-6 weeks, median 2-4 weeks); rechallenge positivity; and HLA associations (HLA-DRB11501, HLA-A0201, HLA-DQB1*0602) strongly suggest adaptive immune response to drug-protein adducts
Cholestatic injury pattern characteristic: 50-70% present with cholestatic or mixed hepatocellular-cholestatic pattern with elevated alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and GGT; pure hepatocellular injury occurs in 20-30%; cholestasis suggests immune-mediated injury to bile duct epithelium (vanishing bile duct syndrome reported in severe cases)
Reactive metabolite formation from clavulanate: Clavulanate undergoes oxidative metabolism generating reactive intermediates that can form protein adducts; these haptenated proteins may trigger immune responses in genetically susceptible individuals; amoxicillin itself forms minimal reactive metabolites explaining lower toxicity as monotherapy
Minimal mitochondrial dysfunction: Unlike valproate or troglitazone, β-lactam antibiotics do not significantly impair mitochondrial function; mitochondrial mechanisms play minimal role in amoxicillin hepatotoxicity, which is predominantly immunologic and cholestatic
Subacute to delayed onset (1-6 weeks): Typical latency of 2-4 weeks consistent with adaptive immune priming; notably, 10-20% of cases develop jaundice after drug discontinuation (up to 6 weeks post-cessation), suggesting ongoing immune-mediated injury even without continued antigen exposure
Age and treatment duration as risk factors: Risk increases with age (>60 years), male sex (2:1 ratio), and longer treatment courses (>14 days); repeated short courses may sensitize patients; mechanisms for age-related susceptibility unclear but may involve immunosenescence or reduced hepatic reserve
Generally reversible with good prognosis: Most cases resolve within 1-3 months after discontinuation; however, 10-15% develop prolonged cholestasis (>6 months), ~1% progress to chronic vanishing bile duct syndrome, and rare acute liver failure occurs (<1%); overall mortality <1%, making it one of the more benign idiosyncratic hepatotoxins despite being a leading cause of drug-induced liver injury by frequency
