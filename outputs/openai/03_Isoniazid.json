    "Clinical phenotype is heterogeneous: many have only transient ALT elevations, while a smaller subset develops clinically significant hepatitis; this output reflects intrinsic idiosyncratic liability rather than incidence under any specific regimen.",
    "Immune involvement is supported by delayed onset and evidence for responses to drug-modified proteins, but the initiating balance between metabolic stress vs immune amplification varies across individuals.",
    "Cholestatic features and bile-transport perturbation are reported (e.g., FXR/BSEP axis changes), but are generally not the dominant pattern compared with hepatocellular injury."
