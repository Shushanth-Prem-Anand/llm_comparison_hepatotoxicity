    "Authoritative reviews indicate caffeine itself has not been linked to clinically apparent liver injury; therefore mechanistic scoring reflects low intrinsic hepatotoxic liability rather than an established DILI phenotype.",
    "Reports of liver injury with energy drinks are confounded by multi-ingredient formulations (e.g., vitamins/other additives); attribution to caffeine alone is uncertain.",
    "At extreme/toxic systemic exposures, secondary hepatic hypoxia/ischemic-like injury patterns have been described in energy-drink contexts, but mechanism is not clearly direct hepatocyte toxicity from caffeine."
