    "Latency is variable (reported from ~1 week to >1 year), though many cases cluster in the first several months; this output summarizes the most typical window rather than extremes.",
    "Mechanistic contributions can differ by individual: some cases appear more immune-allergic/mixed, others more metabolic-mitochondrial; weights reflect aggregate evidence.",
    "BSEP inhibition is a risk factor and may contribute to bile-acid–mediated hepatocyte stress, but clinical injury from diclofenac is often hepatocellular rather than purely cholestatic."
