    "Valproate has multiple clinical phenotypes (transient aminotransferase elevations, acute hepatitis, and microvesicular steatosis/REYE-like presentations); this output reflects the severe mechanistic liability phenotype rather than frequency in any treated cohort.",
    "Reactive-metabolite contribution varies across individuals and may depend on the balance between beta-oxidation vs omega-oxidation pathways and host mitochondrial reserve.",
    "Host susceptibility is a major determinant (e.g., underlying mitochondrial polymerase gamma pathway vulnerability), making dose–response less predictable at the individual level."
