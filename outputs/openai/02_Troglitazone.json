    "Clinical phenotype is idiosyncratic with heterogeneous patterns (hepatocellular vs mixed/cholestatic) and variable latency; mechanistic weights reflect aggregate evidence rather than a single uniform pathway.",
    "BSEP inhibition is strongly supported for certain metabolites (e.g., sulfate conjugate), but translating in vitro transporter inhibition into individual human outcomes remains uncertain.",
    "Immune involvement is plausible as a downstream amplifier (danger signaling after cell stress/adducts) but is less consistently demonstrated as the initiating event compared with metabolic/mitochondrial stress."
