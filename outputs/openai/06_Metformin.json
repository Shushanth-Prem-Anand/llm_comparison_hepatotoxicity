    "True hepatotoxicity appears rare; risk_score reflects intrinsic idiosyncratic liability rather than frequency in treated populations.",
    "Mechanism is not single-pathway: reported cases include cholestatic and mixed patterns, suggesting variable contributions from bile-handling stress and immune-like features.",
    "Reactive-metabolite initiation is less supported because metformin is largely not hepatically metabolized; therefore confidence is moderate rather than high."
